# 0. Abstract

Right now, payout schemes for miners account only for provided hash power. One of
the biggest bitcoin issue is the centralization of transaction selection, this issue is solved
by Stratum v2. Given that Stratum v2 let the miner select their own transaction
(this feature is known as Job Declaration), and that transactions fees might become the
most important part of the mining reward, we need a system that calculate the payouts
based both on selected transactions and hash power provided.

This document proposes an extension of StratumV2, that can be used by the miner to verify pool's
payout. Through this sv2 extension is possible to implement the system proposed in 
[here](https://github.com/demand-open-source/pplns-with-job-declaration/blob/master/pplns-with-job-declaration.pdf).

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", 
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.

# 1. Extension Overview

This extension assume that every miner of the pool mine on top of the same block, in case of a fork
every miner have to be on the same branch, this is also the right thing to do.

This extension let miners verify the pool's reward for a particular window. A miner is expected to
follow the below step in order to do that:

0. ask for the window that want to verify
1. randomly select some slice that he is willing to check
for each selected slice:
    1. randomly select some share in the slice
    2. fetch the job and the transactions that are not in the cache for each selected share
    3. verify that each share is valid
    4. verify that merkle path of each share + share hash = root in the Slice
    5. verify that the sum of the diff verified shares is not bigger then the Slice diff
    6. verify that the fees in the shares are lower than fees of the Slice ref job fees + delta

## 1.1 Data Types
This extension introduce 2 datatypes:

### Slice

A slice represents a group of shares mined when the mempool's maximum extractable fees can be 
approximated as a constant.

| Field Name | Data Type | Description                                                 |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| number_of_shares | U32       | How many shares are in the slice  |
| difficulty | U64  | sum of all the difficulties of the shares that compose the slice |
| fees | U64  | fees of the ref job for this slice |
| root | U256  | merkle root of the tree composed by all the shares in the slice |
| job_id | U64  | id of the ref job for this slice, the last 4 bytes MUST be the same of the job_id of the respective job |

### Share

A share sent by a miner

| Field Name | Data Type | Description                                                 |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| nonce | U32       | Same as in sv2 mining protocol  |
| ntime | U32       | Same as in sv2 mining protocol  |
| version | U32       | Same as in sv2 mining protocol  |
| extranonce | B032       | Same as in sv2 mining protocol  |
| job_id | U64  | id of the job for this slice, the last 4 bytes MUST be the same of the job_id of the respective job |
| reference_job_id | U64  | id of the ref job for this slice, the last 4 bytes MUST be the same of the job_id of the respective job |
| root | U256  | merkle root of the tree composed by all the shares in the slice |
| merkle_path | B064K       | Same as in sv2 mining protocol  |

This extension is an extension of the Mining StratumV2 protocol and message defined here MUST be
sent over an already setup mining connection. 

## 1.2 Activate Extension

TODO this mechanism is discussed [here](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/issues/95),
change the below with whatever we will agreed on.

After that a valid mining connection have been opened with upstream, the client that want to use this
Extension MUST send Activate and the pool that support this extension MUST answer with Activate.Success.
If the pool respond with ` Frame { extension_type, msg_type: 0xff, msg_length: 0, payload: [] }` 
client MUST not send any other messages.

## 1.3 Error

This extension handles errors differently compared to SV2. Instead of using several general errors
for different messages, each message with a handleable error defines a specific response, such as
`GetWindow` with `GetWindow.Busy`. There is only one general error, `ErrorMessage`, which is used for all
irrecoverable errors. It contains a string and MUST be used solely for logging the cause of the error. 
Upon receiving an `ErrorMessage`, the node MUST close the connection.

# 2. Extension Messages

## Activate (Client -> Server)

| Field Name | Data Type | Description                                                 |

## Activate.Success (Server -> Client)

| Field Name | Data Type | Description                                                 |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| request_id | U32  | Unique identifier for pairing the response |

## ShareOk (Server -> Client)

Sent by the pool for each `SubmitShare` submitted by the pool. When this extension is active the pool
MAY not send `SubmitShares.Success`

| Field Name | Data Type | Description                                                 |

| ref_job_id | U64  | id of the ref job for this slice, the last 4 bytes MUST be the same of the job_id of the respective job |
| share_index | U32  | index of this share inside the slice |

## NewBlockFound (Server -> Client)

The pool must send `NewBlockFound` when a miner found a valid block.
this is different from SNPH since is only sent for block found by the pool not for every block.
`NewBlockFound.block_hash` is used by the miner to request a window through `GetWindow`. 

| Field Name | Data Type | Description                                                 |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| block_hash | U256  | block hash of the block that have been found by the pool |

## GetWindow (Client -> Server)

Pools should reply with `GetWindow.Success` for last windows, for older window pool MAY
answer with `GetWindow.Busy`. Pool must not reply with `GeneralError` for valid request a valid
request is a request that have as block_hash the hash of a block found by the pool.

| Field Name | Data Type | Description                                                 |

## GetWindowSuccess (Server -> Client)

First slice (`slice[start]`) must be the first one for which: 
  `sum(slice[start].diff,..., slice[end - 1].diff) >= N * window_size`
Last slice (`slice[end]`) is the slice that have the share that do find a valid block.
Last slice is not used to calculate the reward.

| request_id | U32  | Unique identifier for pairing the response |
| retry_in_seconds | U64  | how many second client MUST wait before retry the request |

## GetShares (Client -> Server)

Client MUST NOT try to get shares that do not belong to the window that the client required, 
and pool authorized with `GetWindow.Success`. If so upstream SHOULD send an error and close the connection.

Share id is calculated from the first share in the first slice that have id = 0 to the last share in
the last slice that have id = shares_in_window.len() - 1.
